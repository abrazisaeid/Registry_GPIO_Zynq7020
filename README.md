# Registry_GPIO_Zynq7020
Change the GPIO State with Registry.

If time is so important for your project the following items can be of great importance to you: 

when you use SDK Xilinx original functions for change in the state of GPIO like XGpioPs_WritePin it makes 1.5 us time for changing but if you use Registry this time reduces to 600ns and it can help you so much.

In this Project, I elaborate the how you can get the amount of any Pin in Any bank of Xilinx registry.
